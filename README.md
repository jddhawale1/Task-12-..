Log Monitoring & Analysis Report
1. Introduction
This report details a log monitoring and analysis exercise, focusing on authentication logs to identify potential security incidents such as brute-force attacks and anomalous login patterns. The analysis was performed using synthetic log data generated to simulate real-world scenarios.

2. Log Types and Collection
For this exercise, SSH authentication logs were simulated. In a real-world scenario, various log types are crucial for comprehensive security monitoring, including:

•	Authentication Logs: Record user login attempts, both successful and failed. (e.g., /var/log/auth.log on Linux)
